App Store "What's New" for the iPhone app. Write it in the change that bumps the version:
a `## <version>` section with one `### <locale>` per App Store language (zh-Hant, en-US),
listing what iPhone users notice, without emoji (the App Store rejects them; asc-submit.py drops
any left). tools/asc-submit.py reads the released version's section;
a version without one gets a generic "Bug fixes and improvements" line. Delete old sections.

## 2.40.0
### zh-Hant
- bot 現在可以讓 dev server 持續在電腦上執行，不會因為 bot 閒置或重新啟動而中斷。port 會顯示在聊天標題下方；點 bot 的名稱，就能看記錄、重新啟動或停止；手機連得到電腦時，也能直接開啟。

### en-US
- Bots can now keep a dev server running on your computer, even when the bot goes idle or restarts. Its port shows under the chat title; tap the bot's name to read its logs, restart or stop it, and to open it when your phone can reach it.
